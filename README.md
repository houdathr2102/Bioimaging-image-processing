research community
After filtering, the script plots two subplots within a single figure:
Original ECG Signal: Plotted in red, this graph shows the unfiltered ECG data as it was recorded. The plot helps in visualizing the baseline level of noise and the true signal waveform.
Filtered ECG Signal: Plotted in blue, this graph displays the ECG data after the application of the median filter. It demonstrates the effectiveness of the filter in smoothing out the noise and enhancing the readability of the ECG.
